# Chess-Database

The goal of this project is to create a PostgreSQL extension for storing and retrieving chess games using Portable Game Notation (PGN), Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), and Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).

## Notations
- **PGN (Portable Game Notation):** Used to record full games. Subset utilized.
- **SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation):** Represents moves in PGN.
- **FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation):** Stores board states.
